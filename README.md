### A Platformer Game Made in Unity2D ###

This was made for my final project at CodeCore Bootcamp, where I was studying
Full Stack Development. I learned C# and Unity2D, which wasn't covered by the
bootcamp, and drew and animated all the assets in Photoshop, Flash and Spine.
I coded the game using the built in methods in Unity, and through C# scripts.
This is a work in progress, and I will implement user authentication, multi player
capabilities, on multi platforms.
